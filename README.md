Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) selection.
====

Paper: http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/papers/icml03.pdf

Implementation of the FCBF algorithm. 

## System requirements

* Updated for Python3
* Works on Linux and Mac. No guarantees for other OS, but may work.

## Usage

Input file format:

  Row: observation vector, Col: Feature/Variable vector

In Python, call 
  
    `fcbf_wrapper(inpath, thresh, delim=',', header=False, classAt=-1)`
  
OR
  
From command line, 
  
    > cd FCBF
    > python src/fcbf.py -h
    usage: fcbf.py [-h] [-inpath] [-thresh] [-delim] [-header] [-classAt]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -inpath     Path to input file
      -thresh     SU threshold
      -delim      File delimiter
      -header     Contains header?
      -classAt    Index of class column
    
    > python src/fcbf.py -inpath='./data/lungcancer.csv' -thresh=0.05
